# calculator.py - a project by springer01
A simple calculator that includes:
> - A looping script, which allows you to keep calculating questions rather than having to keep running the script over and over again
> - includes the import math module, allowing me to add calculations such as calculating sine, cosine, and tangent.
> - the repository includes a brief explanation of what each script does

# misc
> - If you have any questions with the code, or want to give me feedback on how I can improve; the best place you can send them to me in is within my own personal discord server:

>   + do note that I may take a long time to respond to anything, so when telling me anything please give me full information and give me blank sentences like "hello", please. 
>   thanks for reading.
